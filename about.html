                <h1>I'm Backend Developer</h1>
                <p>
                    Since I was 3, I could watch my dad work on his PC everyday (at least that's what he says).
                    I was always interested in how things work and how to make them work better.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When I was 12, I started attending extra IT classes and I fell in love with programming.
                    Coding is not only my passion, but also a way to enhance my skills and knowledge.
                    It brings me a lot of joy.
                    My goal is to become a professional backend developer and work on projects that 
                    will make a difference.

                On an everyday basis, I am a student of Wrocław University of Science and Technology,
                 majoring in IT Automation Systems. I started studying in 2022 and I am expected to graduate in 2027.
                 In my free time, apart from working and playing video games, I like to spend time bouldering,
                    which is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses.

                Recently, my friends intruduced me to RPG games like Dungeons and Dragons and I am addicted to it,
                constantly waiting for the next session. If you ask me about my favourite game, I would say it's
                   Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West. The world, the story,
                   the characters, the music, everything is just perfect in these games for me.

                Coming back to IT stuff, apart from programming web apps, I try my best at maintaining my own home
                server on Raspberry Pi. It's a great way to learn about networking and security. So far, my server has
                been running for 2 years without any major issues. The services I run on it are: Nextcloud, Web server,
                VPN and a few more. I also have a few fun projects that I work on in my free time. One of them is
                <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/xEdziu/RPG-Handy-Helper">RPG Handy Helper</a>, a web app that helps you manage your RPG sessions.
                We just started working on it, but I am sure it will be a great tool for every RPG DM. Recently, I made a small
                project called <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/xEdziu/midi2key">midi2key</a>, a tool that converts MIDI signals to keyboard inputs,
                so one is able to play games with a MIDI controller (such as yamaha keyboard!). After that I am planning to buy a dancing mat... and make it 
                into a controller for multiplayer games like Rainbow Six Siege!
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                I am also very active in terms of social life. I am a member of a few student organizations, such as
                Student Council and Student Scientific Club of IT Automation Systems. I am also a lifeguard and I worked
                3 seasons on polish beaches in Pobierowo. My dream now is to learn how to fly a helicopter and get a license!
